# React/Rails Calculator

This is a calculator built with Rails, webpacker and react-rails. It saves recent calculations to local storage and allows the user to choose whether to evaluate the expressions in the frontend or backend.

You can visit [this link](https://react-rails-calculator.herokuapp.com/) to try the app in production (Give it a chance to load, it's running on a free Heroku dyno).


## To run it locally:

```sh
$ cd react-rails-app
$ bundle && yarn
$ foreman start -f Procfile.dev -p 3000
```
